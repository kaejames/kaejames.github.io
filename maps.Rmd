<img src="docs/chelsea_gov.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center">


Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate **Maura Healey** under performed in Suffolk County where she got less than 80% of the vote mainly because she did the worst in city of Chelsea. Healy was held under 60% while running unopposed since her opponent dropped out of the race. It's not surprising Healey didn't do well in Chelsea since it's one of the most liberal city in the county and she was deemed not liberal enough. 

<br>

### <span style="color: #f72585;"> Republican Senate Primary </span>

The Republican primary featured tv host Dr.Oz, businessman Dave McCormick and YouTuber rightwing activist Kathy Barnette. Dr.Oz easily won Philadelphia that ultimately gave him the edge statewide against McCormick. Maybe Dr.Oz did well in the city since he lived across the river in New Jersey?lol.  

<img src="docs/phillyprimgop.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center">

Since Philadelphia is a strong Democratic city, many precincts didn't have votes especialy the black populated areas shaded in yellow. There were also many precincts where the three candidates tied the vote that is shaded black. It will be interesting to see how Dr.Oz will do in November against Fetterman.
