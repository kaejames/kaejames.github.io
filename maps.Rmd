Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate **Maura Healey** under performed in Suffolk County where she got less than 80% of the vote mainly because she did the worst in city of Chelsea. Healy was held under 60% while running unopposed since her opponent dropped out of the race. It's not surprising Healey didn't do well in Chelsea since it's one of the most liberal city in the county and she was deemed not liberal enough.

Since Philadelphia is a strong Democratic city, many precincts didn't have votes especialy the black populated areas shaded in yellow.
