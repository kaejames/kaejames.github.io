Hillsborough County Judge Jared Smith made national headlines in the New Year[2022] after he denied abortion to a 17 yr old due to her "B" grades which he said it proved the the teenager was not smart to make her decisions. Smith's ruling was later overturned. In April, local attorney Nancy L.Jacobs filed to run against Smith.

Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate **Maura Healy** under performed in Suffolk County where she got less than 80% of the vote mainly because she did the worst in city of Chelsea. Healy was held under 60% while running unopposed since her opponent dropped out of the race. It's not surprising Healy didn't do well in Chelsea since it's one of the most liberal city in the county and she was deemed not liberal enough.

For the Suffolk County District Attorney, it was appointed incumbent DA Hayden vs city of Boston council member Ricardo Arroyo.
