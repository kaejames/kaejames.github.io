The primary for this nonpartisan judicial race was on August 23, 2022. Nancy L.Jacobs defeated incumbent Judge Smith 51.9% to 48.1%.Hillsborough County Judge Jared Smith made natinal headlines in the New Year[2022] after he denied abortion to a 17 yr old due to her "B" grades which he said it proved the the teenager was not smart to make her decisions. Smith's ruling was later overturned. In April, local attorney Nancy L.Jacobs filed to run against Smith. Although this a nonpartisan position, Jacobs received support from local Democratic party activists and abortion rights advocates.
