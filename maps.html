<p><img src="docs/HC.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 20px" align="center"></p>
<p>Hillsborough County Judge Jared Smith made national headlines in the
New Year[2022] after he denied abortion to a 17 yr old due to her “B”
grades which he said it proved the the teenager was not smart to make
her decisions. Smith’s ruling was later overturned. In April, local
attorney Nancy L.Jacobs filed to run against Smith. Although this a
nonpartisan position, Jacobs received support from local Democratic
party, activists and abortion rights advocates.</p>

<p><img src="docs/MAQ2_2012.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>The NO vote narrowly won the vote because it won the three more

towns to the YES vote winning 183 towns out of 351 townships. The YES
vote won 52.1% of the towns to 47.9% of the NO, ironically close to the
raw vote % numbers. The NO vote did best in high religious towns in the
Central, Boston area and the Southern part of the state. The YES vote
did best in towns in the Western part of the state, which is also the
most liberal part of Massachusetts.Question 2 initiative proponents

was higher than Hayden’s win margin. The turnout was also low by about
16,000 less voters compared to 2018. This primary was marred by
controversy by both candidates and they were both not liked by the
voters. Hayden’s term ends in 2024 where he will likely face a better

</span></h3>
<p>South Korea held it’s presidential election on March 9th 2022. The
contest was between conservative candidate and former prosecutor general
Yoon suk-yeol and liberal Gyeonggi former governor Lee Jae-myung. Yoon
led the polls most of the campaign and more so in late 2021 and through
the new year. The liberal incumbent president Moon was very unpopular
and it was going to be a tough task for Lee to overcome. The election
ended up being the closest since 2002 and Yoon won by 0.8%.</p>
<p><img src="docs/korea_22_region.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Yoon ran-up the margins in the conservative base of eastern and south
east part of the country and Lee also ran-up his margins in south
western. The election came down to the Seoul and greater Seoul area in
Gyeonggi home to Lee. Lee under performed his 2018 gubernatorial
election in which he had won by 21%. Lee won Gyeonggi by 5.6% which made
it hard since he lost Seoul to Yoon who racked up huge margins in the
wealthy areas south of river Han.</p>

known worldwide. This election followed the presidential election in

<p>The statewide and local primaries were held on May 17th, 2022 across

primary, Democrats got 87.7% and the Republicans got 12.3% out of 248k
total ballots cast.</p>
<div id="democratic-senate-primary" class="section level3">
<h3><span style="color: #4361ee;"> Democratic Senate Primary
</span></h3>
<p>The Democratic primary for the senate was between the Lt.Gov
Fetterman, State Rep Kenyatta and Congressman Lamb. Fetterman beat
Kenyatta by more than 2% and went on to win the state primary. Fetterman
did well in the white, liberal and working class areas, while Kenyatta
and Lamb did well in black and latino areas respectively.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #f72585;"> Republican Senate Primary
</span></h3>
<p>The Republican primary featured tv host Dr.Oz, businessman Dave
McCormick and YouTuber rightwing activist Kathy Barnette. Dr.Oz easily
won Philadelphia that ultimately gave him the edge statewide against
McCormick. Maybe Dr.Oz did well in the city since he lived across the
river in New Jersey?lol.</p>
<p><img src="docs/phillyprimgop.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Since Philadelphia is a strong Democratic city, many precincts didn’t
have votes especialy the black populated areas shaded in yellow. There
were also many precincts where the three candidates tied the vote that
is shaded black. It will be interesting to see how Dr.Oz will do in
November against Fetterman.</p>
