<p>Hillsborough County Judge Jared Smith made national headlines in the
New Year[2022] after he denied abortion to a 17 yr old due to her “B”
grades which he said it proved the the teenager was not smart to make
her decisions. Smith’s ruling was later overturned. In April, local
attorney Nancy L.Jacobs filed to run against Smith. Although this a
nonpartisan position, Jacobs received support from local Democratic
party, activists and abortion rights advocates.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0066;"> ’13 Presidential Election
</span></h3>
<p>2013 Presidential election was between two family dynasty, Kenyatta
and Odinga and the first of two match ups.</p>
<p><img src="docs/KEGE_13.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Uhuru Kenyatta beat Raila Odinga the ex-Prime Minister under
President Kibwaki to become the president after he failed in 2002 and
2007 which followed violence across the country. This election broke
along tribes with Uhuru who is of Kikuyu tribe, dominated in the
central-midland area where Kikuyu’s live and Odinga dominated in the
west which is dominated by the Luo tribe. Odinga did well in the capital
city, Nairobi which is diverse with all tribes and the coastal region of
Mombasa.</p>

<div id="presidential-election-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span style="color: #ff0066;"> ’17 Presidential Election

<p>The 2017 was a re-match between President Uhuru and Raila

and only county</em></strong>).</p>
<p><img src="docs/KEGE_17.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>The 2017 election results were similar to 2013, Uhuru won big in the
central and mid-lands while Odinga won big in the west and the coastal
region. This election saw more than 3.5 million more voters than 2013
and Uhuru defeated Odinga by more than 9%.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0066;"> ’22 Presidential Election

<p>The 2022 election was the third try in 9 years for the State House
for Raila Odinga against Vice President Ruto and he came the closest but
fell short.</p>
<p><img src="docs/KEGE_22.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Raila Odinga came the closest to winning in 2022, he lost by 1.6% or
233,211 votes to VP Ruto. Odinga under performed in the coastal region
from his previous two attempts, if he had maintained the margins in the
capital city and the coast region he could have won. Vice President Ruto
did enough to eek out a victory by maintaining the Uhuru margins in the
Central and Mid-Lands regions. Odinga won 27 counties to 20 for Ruto and
over 150 constituencies to 120 for Ruto. Ruto won areas with more votes
compared to Odinga.</p>

<p><img src="docs/MA2022Q1.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Question #1 did the best in Suffolk County and did poorly in
Worcester County than expected. The measure failed in Norfolk and
Plymouth County towns as expected for it’s wealth and conservative
towns.</p>
<p><strong>In depth look at how the 30 richest towns/cities
voted.</strong></p>
<p><img src="docs/MA30TOWNS.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>The towns with over $200,000 median household income voted against
the measure with Dover, Wellesley and Weston overwhelmingly voting
against. Question #1 surprisingly won in Carlisle, Wayland, Lexington
and Manchester-by-the-sea which are among the top 10 richest towns.</p>

<p><img src="docs/MAQ2_2012.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>The NO vote narrowly won the vote because it won the three more
populated counties of Essex,Norfolk and Worcester. The NO vote won 168
towns to the YES vote winning 183 towns out of 351 townships. The YES
vote won 52.1% of the towns to 47.9% of the NO, ironically close to the
raw vote % numbers. The NO vote did best in high religious towns in the
Central, Boston area and the Southern part of the state. The YES vote
did best in towns in the Western part of the state, which is also the
most liberal part of Massachusetts.Question 2 initiative proponents
thought they would join the State of Washington as the second state to
approve assisted suicide.</p>

<p>Rachel Rollins won the district attorney primary with plurality by
defeating three other candidates. Rollins won Cities of Boston and
Chelsea but lost the smaller cities of Revere and Winthrop. Rollins win
was important to the reform movement as she supported criminal justice
reform. She went on to win in November and in 2021 President Biden

<p>The primary was held on September 6th, 2022 among other local and
statewide elections. DA Hayden won the primary by 7.1%, he narrowly won
Boston and dominated in Revere and Winthrop and Arroyo won city of
Chelsea by 12%. About 9.7% of the voters left their ballot blanks which
was higher than Hayden’s win margin. The turnout was also low by about
16,000 less voters compared to 2018. This primary was marred by
controversy by both candidates and they were both not liked by the
voters. Hayden’s term ends in 2024 where he will likely face a better
challenger. <br></p>

received 52,420 more votes than Whitmer and ran 2% better statewide. The
No lost with 61,254 few votes than Tudor for a 13% loss. Gov Whitmer
running stronger in Wayne County where city of Detroit is located shows

medical care to be provided to infants born alive after an induced
labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion, or another method and

<h3><span style="color: #f72585;"> 2022 Presidential Election
</span></h3>
<p>South Korea held it’s presidential election on March 9th 2022. The
contest was between conservative candidate and former prosecutor general
Yoon suk-yeol and liberal Gyeonggi former governor Lee Jae-myung. Yoon
led the polls most of the campaign and more so in late 2021 and through
the new year. The liberal incumbent president Moon was very unpopular
and it was going to be a tough task for Lee to overcome. The election
ended up being the closest since 2002 and Yoon won by 0.8%.</p>
<p><img src="docs/korea_22_region.png" style="width:100%; solid; margin-center: 350px" align="center"></p>
<p>Yoon ran-up the margins in the conservative base of eastern and south
east part of the country and Lee also ran-up his margins in south
western. The election came down to the Seoul and greater Seoul area in
Gyeonggi home to Lee. Lee under performed his 2018 gubernatorial
election in which he had won by 21%. Lee won Gyeonggi by 5.6% which made
it hard since he lost Seoul to Yoon who racked up huge margins in the
wealthy areas south of river Han.</p>
