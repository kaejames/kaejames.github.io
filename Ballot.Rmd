Women voters are important and more important to Democrats winning. 

Using __Echelon Insights, Fox News Poll and Monmouth University Poll__, I looked at the generic ballot beginning from Jan 2022 and compared the two party support. 

The Republicans led the generic poll from Jan to June because they averaged over 40% support from women. 

The support fell in July and August to a low of 38%. Democrats support from women maintained throughout the year hovering between 47% and at itâ€™s highest 51%. 

The supreme court ruling on abortion may have had a negative effect on republicans women support.

Democrats took their first lead in July by **0.5%** and have extended the lead to ***3%*** thanks to strong women support.
